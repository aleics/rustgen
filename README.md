# rustgen
This repository includes basic implementations of genetic algorithms as an
exercise to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

The following algorithms are planned to be implemented:
- [x] Onemax
- [x] Travel Salesman Problem (TSP)
- [ ] NSGA-II
- [ ] CMA-ES
- [ ] Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP)

## Notes
After the implementation of each algorithm, it's planned to create an util
library of the more often used functions.
